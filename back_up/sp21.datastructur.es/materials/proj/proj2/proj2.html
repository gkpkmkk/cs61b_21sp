<h2 id="a-note-on-this-spec">A note on this spec</h2>

<p>This spec is fairly long. The first half is a verbose and detailed description
of every command you’ll support, and the other half is the testing details and
some words of advice. To help you digest this, we’ve prepared many high quality
videos describing portions of the spec and giving advice on how and where to
begin. All videos are linked throughout this spec in the relevant location, but
we’ll also list them right here for your convenience. Note: some of these videos
were created in Spring 2020 when Gitlet was Project 3 and Capers was Lab 12, and
some videos briefly mention Professor Hilfinger’s CS 61B setup (including a
remote called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shared</code>, a repository called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repo</code>, etc).  Please ignore these
as they do not provide any useful information for you this semester. The actual
content of the assignment is unchanged.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-gitlet">Overview of Gitlet</h2>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Ensure you’ve completed <a href="../../lab/lab6/lab6.html">Lab 6: Canine Capers</a>
before this project. Lab 6 is intended to be an introduction to this project and
will be very helpful in getting you started and ensure you’re all set up. You should also
have watched <a href="https://youtu.be/fvhqn5PeU_Q">Lecture 12: Gitlet</a>, which introduces
many useful ideas for this project.</p>

<p>In this project you’ll be implementing a version-control system that mimics some
of the basic features of the popular system Git.  Ours is smaller and simpler,
however, so we have named it Gitlet.</p>

<p>A version-control system is essentially a backup system for related collections
of files. The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Saving the contents of entire directories of files.
In Gitlet, this is called <em>committing</em>, and the saved contents themselves are
called <em>commits</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits.
In Gitlet, this is called <em>checking out</em> those files or that commit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Viewing the history of your backups. In Gitlet, you view this
history in something called the <em>log</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintaining related sequences of commits, called <em>branches</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Merging changes made in one branch into another.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The point of a version-control system is to help you when creating
complicated (or even not-so-complicated) projects, or when collaborating
with others on a project.
You save versions of the project periodically.
If at some later point in time you
accidentally mess up your code, then you can restore your source to
a previously committed version (without losing any of the changes
you made since then).  If your collaborators make changes embodied in a commit,
you can incorporate (<em>merge</em>) these changes into your own version.</p>

<p>In Gitlet, you don’t just commit individual files at a time. Instead,
you can commit a coherent set of files at the same time. We like to think of
each commit as a <em>snapshot</em> of your entire project at one point
in time. However, for simplicity, many of the examples in the
remainder of this document involve changes to just one file at a time.
Just keep in mind you could change multiple files in each commit.</p>

<p>In this project, it will be helpful for us to visualize the commits we
make over time. Suppose we have a project consisting just of the
file wug.txt, we add some text to
it, and commit it. Then we modify the file and commit these changes.
Then we modify the file again, and commit the changes again. Now we
have saved three total versions of this file, each one later
in time than the previous. We can visualize these commits like so:</p>

<p><img src="image/three_commits.png" alt="Three commits" /></p>

<p>Here we’ve drawn an arrow indicating that each commit contains some
kind of reference to the commit that came before it. We call the
commit that came before it the <em>parent commit</em>–this will be important
later. But for now, does this drawing look familiar? That’s right;
it’s a linked list!</p>

<p>The big idea behind Gitlet is that we can visualize the history of the
different versions of our files in a list like this. Then it’s easy
for us to restore old versions of files. You can imagine making a
command like: “Gitlet, please revert to the state of the files at
commit #2”, and it would go to the second node in the linked list and
restore the copies of files found there, while removing any files that are in the
first node, but not the second.</p>

<p>If we tell Gitlet to revert to an old commit, the front of the linked
list will no longer reflect the current state of your files, which
might be a little misleading. In order to fix this problem, we
introduce something called the <em>head</em> pointer (also called the HEAD pointer).
The head pointer keeps track of where in the linked list we currently are.
Normally, as we make commits, the head pointer will stay at the front of the
linked list, indicating that the latest commit reflects the current state of the
files:</p>

<p><img src="image/simple_head.png" alt="Simple head" /></p>

<p>However, let’s say we revert to the state of the files at commit #2
(technically, this is the <em>reset</em> command, which you’ll see later in
the spec). We move the head pointer back to show this:</p>

<p><img src="image/reverted_head.png" alt="Reverted head" /></p>

<p>Here we say that we are in a <em>detatched head state</em> which you may have
encountered yourself before. This is what it means!</p>

<p>EDITED 3/5: Note that in Gitlet, there is no way to be in a detached head state
since there is no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkout</code> command that will move the HEAD pointer to a
specific commit. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reset</code> command will do that, though it also moves the
branch pointer. Thus, in Gitlet, you will never be in a detached HEAD state.</p>

<p>All right, now, if this were all Gitlet could do, it would be a pretty
simple system. But Gitlet has one more trick up its sleeve: it doesn’t
just maintain older and newer versions of files, it can maintain
<em>differing</em> versions. Imagine you’re coding a project, and you have
two ideas about how to proceed: let’s call one Plan A, and the other
Plan B. Gitlet allows you to save both versions, and switch between
them at will. Here’s what this might look like, in our pictures:</p>

<p><img src="image/two_versions.png" alt="Two versions" /></p>

<p>It’s not really a linked list anymore. It’s more like a tree. We’ll
call this thing the <em>commit tree</em>. Keeping with this metaphor, each of
the separate versions is called a <em>branch</em> of the tree. You can
develop each version separately:</p>

<p><img src="image/two_developed_versions.png" alt="Two developed versions" /></p>

<p>There are two pointers into the tree, representing the furthest
point of each branch. At any given time, only one of these is the
currently active pointer, and this is what’s called the head pointer. The
head pointer is the pointer at the front of the current branch.</p>

<p>That’s it for our brief overview of the Gitlet system! Don’t worry if
you don’t fully understand it yet; the section above was just to give
you a high level picture of what its meant to do. A detailed spec of
what you’re supposed to do for this project follows this section.</p>

<p>But a last word here: commit trees are
<em>immutable</em>: once a commit node has been created, it can
never be destroyed (or changed at all). We can only add new things to
the commit tree, not modify existing things. This is an important
feature of Gitlet! One of Gitlet’s
goals is to allow us to save things so we don’t delete
them accidentally.</p>

<h2 id="internal-structures">Internal Structures</h2>

<p>Real Git distinguishes several different kinds of <em>objects</em>.  For
our purposes, the important ones are</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>blobs</em></strong>: The saved contents of files. Since Gitlet saves many versions of
      files, a single file might correspond to multiple blobs: each being
      tracked in a different commit.</li>
  <li><strong><em>trees</em></strong>: Directory structures mapping names to references to blobs and
other trees (subdirectories).</li>
  <li><strong><em>commits</em></strong>: Combinations of log messages,
other metadata (commit date, author,
etc.), a reference to a tree, and references to
parent commits.
The repository also maintains a mapping from <em>branch heads</em> to references to
commits, so that certain important commits have symbolic names.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gitlet simplifies from Git still further by</p>
<ul>
  <li>Incorporating trees into commits and not dealing with subdirectories (so
there will be one
“flat” directory of plain files for each repository).</li>
  <li>Limiting ourselves to merges that reference two parents (in real Git, there
can be any number of parents.)</li>
  <li>Having our metadata consist only of a timestamp and log message.
A commit, therefore, will consist of a log message,
timestamp, a mapping of file names to blob references, a parent
reference, and (for merges) a second parent reference.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every object–every blob and every commit in our case–has a unique
integer id that serves as a reference to the object.  An interesting feature of
Git is that these ids are <em>universal</em>:  unlike a typical Java implementation,
two objects with exactly the same content will have the same id on all systems
(i.e. my computer, your computer, and anyone else’s computer will compute this
same exact id).  In the case of blobs, “same content” means the same file
contents.  In the case of commits, it means the same metadata, the same mapping
of names to references, and the same parent reference.  The objects in a
repository are thus said to be <em>content addressable</em>.</p>

<p>Both Git and Gitlet accomplish this the same way: by using a <em>cryptographic
hash function</em> called SHA-1 (Secure Hash 1), which produces a 160-bit integer
hash from any sequence of bytes. Cryptographic hash functions have the property
that it is extremely difficult to find two different byte streams with the
same hash value (or indeed to find <em>any</em> byte stream given just its hash value),
so that essentially, we may assume that the probability
that any two objects with different contents have the same SHA-1 hash value is
2<sup>-160</sup> or about 10<sup>-48</sup>.  Basically, we simply ignore the
possibility of a hashing collision, so that the system has, in principle,
a fundamental bug that in practice never occurs!</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are library classes for computing SHA-1 values, so you won’t
have to deal with the actual algorithm.
All you have to do is to make sure that you
correctly label all your objects.  In particular, this involves</p>

<ul>
  <li>Including all metadata and references when hashing a commit.</li>
  <li>Distinguishing somehow between hashes for commits and hashes for blobs.  A
  good way of doing this involves a well-thought out directory structure
  within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> directory. Another way to do so is to hash in an extra
  word for each object that has one value for blobs and another for commits.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, the SHA-1 hash value, rendered as a 40-character
hexadecimal string, makes
a convenient file name for storing your data in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code>
directory (more on that below).  It also gives you a convenient way to
compare two files (blobs) to see if they have the same contents: if their
SHA-1s are the same, we simply assume the files are the same.</p>

<p>For remotes (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skeleton</code> which we’ve been using all semester),
we’ll simply use other Gitlet repositories.  Pushing simply means copying all
commits and blobs that the remote repository does not yet have to the remote
repository, and resetting a branch reference.  Pulling is the same, but in the
other direction. Remotes are extra credit in this project and not required for
full credit.</p>

<p>Reading and writing your internal objects from and to files is actually pretty
easy, thanks to Java’s <em>serialization</em> facilities.  The interface
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.io.Serializable</code> has no methods,
but if a class implements it, then the Java
runtime will automatically provide a way to convert to and from a stream of
bytes, which you can then write to a file using the I/O class
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.io.ObjectOutputStream</code> and read back (and deserialize) with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.io.ObjectInputStream</code>.
The term “serialization” refers to the conversion from some arbitrary structure
(array, tree, graph, etc.) to a serial sequence of bytes. You should have seen
and gotten practice with serialization in lab 6. You’ll be using a very similar
approach here, so do use your lab6 as a resource when it comes to persistence
and serialization.</p>

<p>Here is a summary example of the structures discussed in this section.
As you can see, each commit (rectangle) points to some blobs (circles), which
contain file contents.  The commits contain the file names and references to
these blobs, as well as a parent link.  These references, depicted as arrows,
are represented in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> directory using their SHA-1 hash values (the
small hexadecimal numerals above the commits and below the blobs).  The newer
commit contains an updated version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wug1.txt</code>, but shares the same version
of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wug2.txt</code> as the older commit. Your commit class will somehow store all of
the information that this diagram shows: a careful selection of internal data
structures will make the implementation easier or harder, so it behooves you to
spend time planning and thinking about the best way to store everything.</p>

<p><img src="image/commits-and-blobs.png" alt="Two commits and their blobs" /></p>

<h2 id="detailed-spec-of-behavior">Detailed Spec of Behavior</h2>

<h4 id="overall-spec">Overall Spec</h4>

<p>The only structure requirement we’re giving you is that you have a
class named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlet.Main</code> and that it has a main method.</p>

<p>We are also giving you some utility methods for performing a number of
mostly file-system-related tasks, so that you can concentrate on the logic
of the project rather than the peculiarities of dealing with the OS.</p>

<p>We have also added two suggested classes: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Commit</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Repository</code>
to get you started.  You may, of course, write additional Java classes to
support your project or remove our suggested classes if you’d like. But don’t
use any external code (aside from JUnit), and don’t use any programming language
other than Java.  You can use all of the Java Standard Library that you wish,
plus utilities we provide.</p>

<p><strong>You should not do everything in the Main class.</strong> Your Main class should mostly
be calling helper methods in the the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Repository</code> class. See the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CapersRepository</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Main</code> classes from lab 6 for examples of the structure that we recommend.</p>

<p>The majority of this spec will describe how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gitlet.java</code>’s main
method must react when it receives various gitlet commands as
command-line arguments. But before we break down command-by-command,
here are some overall guidelines the whole project should
satisfy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In order for Gitlet to work, it will need a place to store old
copies of files and other
metadata. All of this stuff <strong>must</strong> be stored in a directory called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code>, just as this information is stored in directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> for the
real git system (files with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code> in front are hidden files. You will
not be able to see them by default on most operating systems.  On Unix,
the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls -a</code> will show them.) A
Gitlet system is considered “initialized” in a particular location if
it has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> directory there. Most Gitlet commands (except for the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init</code>  command) only need to work when used from a directory where a
Gitlet system has been initialized–i.e. a directory that has a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> directory. The files that <em>aren’t</em> in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code>
directory (which are copies of files from the repository that you are
using and editing, as well as files you plan to add to the repository) are
referred to as the files in your <em>working directory</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most commands have runtime or memory usage requirements. You must
follow these. Some of the runtimes are described as constant
“relative to any significant measure”. The significant measures are:
any measure of number or size of files, any measure of number of
commits. You can ignore time required to serialize or deserialize,
<em>with the one caveat that your serialization time cannot depend in
any way on the total size of files that have been added, committed,
etc</em> (what is serialization? Revisit Lab 6 if you don’t know!). You can
also pretend that getting from a hash table is constant time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some commands have failure cases with a specified error message. The
exact formats of these are specified later in the spec. All error
message end with a period; since our autograding is literal, be
sure to include it. If your
program ever encounters one of these failure cases, it must print
the error message and not change anything else. <em>You don’t need to
handle any other error cases except the ones listed as failure
cases</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some failure cases you need to handle that don’t apply to
a particular command. Here they are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If a user doesn’t input any arguments, print the message
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Please enter a command.</code> and exit.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If a user inputs a command that doesn’t exist, print the
message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">No command with that name exists.</code> and exit.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If a user inputs a command with the wrong number or format of
operands, print the message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Incorrect operands.</code> and exit.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If a user inputs a command that requires being in an initialized
Gitlet working directory (i.e., one containing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> subdirectory),
but is not in such a directory, print the message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Not in an initialized
Gitlet directory.</code></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the commands have their differences from real Git
listed. The spec is not exhaustive in listing <em>all</em> differences from
Git, but it does list some of the bigger or potentially confusing
and misleading ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> print out anything except for what the spec says. Some of
our autograder tests will break if you print anything more than
necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To exit your program immediately, you may call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">System.exit(0)</code>. For example,  if an error <br />
occurs in the middle of a helper function and you want gitlet to terminate immediately, you would call this function. <strong>Note: You should always supply the argument 0</strong> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">System.exit(0)</code>command. In 61C, you will learn what the argument (known as an error code) means.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The spec classifies some commands as “dangerous”. Dangerous commands
are ones that potentially overwrite files (that aren’t just
metadata)–for example, if a user tells Gitlet to restore files to
older versions, Gitlet may overwrite the current versions of the
files. Just FYI. So put a helmet on before you test these commands :)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-commands">The Commands</h2>

<p>We now go through each command you must support in detail. Remember that good
programmers always care about their data structures: as you read these commands,
you should think first about how you should store your data to easily support
these commands and second about if there is any opportunity to reuse commands
that you’ve already implemented (hint: there is ample opportunity in this
project to reuse code in later parts of project 2 that you’ve already written in earlier parts of project 2). We have listed lectures in some
methods that we have found useful, but you are not required to use concepts from
these lectures. There are conceptual quizzes on some of the more confusing
commands that you should definately use to check your understanding. <strong>The
quizzes are not for a grade</strong>, they are only there to help you check your
understanding before trying to implement the command.</p>

<h4 id="init">init</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main init</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Creates a new Gitlet version-control system in the
current directory. This system will automatically start with one
commit: a commit that contains no files and has the commit message
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initial commit</code> (just like that, with no punctuation).
It will have a single branch: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>, which
initially points to this initial commit, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> will be the
current branch.  The timestamp for this initial commit will be
00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970 in whatever format you
choose for dates (this is
called “The (Unix) Epoch”, represented internally by the time 0.)
Since the initial commit in all repositories
created by Gitlet will have exactly the same content,
it follows that all repositories will automatically share
this commit (they will all have the same UID)
and all commits in all repositories will trace back to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Runtime</strong>: Should be constant relative to any significant measure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failure cases</strong>: If there is already a Gitlet version-control
system in the current directory, it should abort. It should NOT
overwrite the existing system with a new one. Should print the error
message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A Gitlet version-control system already exists in the
current directory.</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dangerous?</strong>: No</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Our line count</strong>: ~15</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="add">add</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main add [file name]</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Adds a copy of the file as it currently exists to
the <em>staging area</em> (see the description of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit</code>
command).  For this reason, adding a file is also
called <em>staging</em> the file <em>for addition</em>.
Staging an already-staged file overwrites the previous entry
in the staging area with the new contents.
The staging area should be somewhere in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code>. If the current working version of the file is identical to
the version in the current commit, do not stage it to be added, and remove it
from the staging area if it is already there (as can happen when a file is
changed, added, and then changed back to it’s original version).  The file
will no longer be staged for removal (see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlet rm</code>), if it
was at the time of the command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Runtime</strong>: In the worst case, should run in linear time relative
to the size of the file being added and $\lg N$, for $N$ the
number of files in the commit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failure cases</strong>: If the file does not exist, print the error
message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File does not exist.</code> and exit without changing
anything.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dangerous?</strong>: No</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Our line count</strong>: ~20</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Differences from real git</strong>: In real git, multiple files may be added at once. In gitlet, only one file may be added at a time.</p>

<h4 id="commit">commit</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main commit [message]</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Saves a snapshot of tracked files in the current commit
and staging area so they can be
restored at a later time, creating a new commit.
The commit is said to be <em>tracking</em> the saved files. By default,
each commit’s snapshot of files will be exactly the same as its
parent commit’s snapshot of files; it will keep versions of files
exactly as they are, and not update them. A commit will only update
the contents of files it is tracking that have been staged
for addition at
the time of commit, in which case the commit will now include the
version of the file that was staged instead of the version it got
from its parent. A commit will save and start tracking any files
that were staged for addition but weren’t tracked by its parent.  Finally, files tracked
in the current commit may be untracked in the new commit as a result
being <em>staged for removal</em> by the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm</code> command (below).</p>

    <p>The bottom line: By default a commit has the same file contents as its parent.
Files staged for addition and removal are the updates to the commit. Of
course, the date (and likely the mesage) will also different from the parent.</p>

    <p>Some additional points about commit:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The staging area is cleared after a commit.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The commit command never adds, changes, or removes files in the
working directory (other than those in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> directory).  The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm</code> command <em>will</em> remove such files, as well as staging them for
removal, so that they will be untracked after a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any changes made to files after staging for addition or removal
are ignored by the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit</code> command, which <em>only</em> modifies the contents of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code>
directory.  For example, if you remove a tracked file using the Unix
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm</code> command (rather than Gitlet’s command of the same name), it has no
effect on the next commit, which will still contain the (now deleted)
version of the file.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After the commit command, the new commit is added as a new node
in the commit tree.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The commit just made becomes the “current commit”, and the head
pointer now points to it. The previous head commit is this
commit’s parent commit.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each commit should contain the date and time it was made.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each commit has a log message associated with it that describes the
changes to the files in the commit. This is specified by the
user. The entire message should take up only one entry in
the array <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">args</code> that is passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>. To include multiword
messages, you’ll have to surround them in quotes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each commit is identified by its SHA-1 id, which must include the
file (blob) references of its files,
parent reference, log message, and commit time.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Runtime</strong>: Runtime should be constant with respect to any measure
of number of commits. Runtime must be no worse than linear with
respect to the total size of files the commit is tracking.
Additionally, this command has a memory requirement: Committing must
increase the size of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> directory by no more than the total
size of the files staged for addition at the time of commit, not including
additional metadata. This means don’t store redundant copies of
versions of files that a commit receives from its parent (hint: remember that
blobs are content addressable and use the SHA1 to your advantage).
You <em>are</em> allowed to save whole additional copies of files;
don’t worry about only saving diffs, or anything like that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failure cases</strong>: If no files have been staged, abort. Print the message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">No
changes added to the commit.</code> Every commit must have a non-blank
message. If it doesn’t, print the error message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Please enter
a commit message.</code> It is <em>not</em> a failure for tracked files to be
missing from the working directory or changed in the working directory.
Just ignore everything outside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> directory entirely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dangerous?</strong>: No</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Differences from real git</strong>: In real git, commits may have multiple
parents (due to merging) and also have considerably more metadata.</p>

<h4 id="rm">rm</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main rm [file name]</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Unstage the file if it is currently staged for addition.
If the file is tracked in the current commit, stage it for removal and
remove the file from the working directory if the user has not already done so
(do <em>not</em> remove it unless it is tracked in the current commit).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Runtime</strong>: Should run in constant time relative to any significant measure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failure cases</strong>: If the file is neither staged nor tracked by the
head commit, print the error message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">No reason to remove the file.</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dangerous?</strong>: Yes (although if you use our utility methods, you will only

<h4 id="log">log</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main log</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Starting at the current head commit, display
information about each commit backwards along the commit tree until
the initial commit, following the first parent commit links, ignoring any
second parents found in merge commits.  (In regular Git, this is what
you get with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git log --first-parent</code>).
This set of commit nodes is called the commit’s
<em>history</em>. For every node in this history, the information it should
display is the commit id, the time the commit was made, and the
commit message. Here is an example of the <em>exact</em> format it should
follow:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>===

<p>There is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">===</code> before each commit and an empty line after it.
  As in real Git, each entry displays the unique SHA-1 id of the commit
  object. The timestamps displayed in the commits reflect
  the current timezone, not UTC; as a result, the timestamp for the initial
  commit does not read Thursday, January 1st, 1970, 00:00:00, but rather the
  equivalent Pacific Standard Time. Your timezone might be different depending
  on where you live, and that’s fine.</p>

<p>Display commits with the most recent at the top. By the way, you’ll find
  that the Java classes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.util.Date</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.util.Formatter</code>
  are useful for getting and formatting times.
  Look into them instead of trying to construct
  it manually yourself!</p>

<p>Of course, the SHA1 identifiers are going to be different, so don’t worry
  about those. Our tests will ensure that you have something that “looks like” a
  SHA1 identifier (more on that in the testing section below).</p>

<p>For merge commits (those that have two parent commits),
  add a line just below the first, as in</p>

would print out information about the circled commits:</p>

<p><img src="image/history.png" alt="History" /></p>

<p>The history ignores other branches and the future. Now that we have
the concept of history, let’s refine what we said earlier about the
commit tree being immutable. It is immutable precisely in the sense
that <em>the history of a commit with a particular id may never change,
ever</em>. If you think of the commit tree as nothing more than a
collection of histories, then what we’re really saying is that each
history is immutable.</p>

If there are multiple such commits, it prints the
ids out on separate lines.  The commit message is a single operand; to
indicate a multiword message, put the operand in quotation marks, as for

<p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[commit id]</code> is, as described earlier, a hexadecimal numeral.  A convenient
feature of real Git is that one can abbreviate commits with a unique
prefix.  For example, one can abbreviate</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a0da1ea5a15ab613bf9961fd86f010cf74c7ee48
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>as</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a0da1e
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>in the (likely) event that no other object exists with a SHA-1 identifier that
starts with the same six digits.  You should arrange for the same thing to
happen for commit ids that contain fewer than 40 characters.  Unfortunately,
using shortened ids might slow down the finding of objects if implemented
naively (making the time to find a file linear in the number of objects), so
we won’t worry about timing for commands that use shortened ids.  We suggest,
however, that you poke around in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git</code> directory (specifically,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.git/objects</code>) and see how it manages to speed up its search. You will perhaps
recognize a familiar data structure implemented with the file system rather
than pointers.</p>

<p>Only version 3 (checkout of a full branch) modifies the staging area:
otherwise files scheduled for
addition or removal remain so.</p>

    <p><strong>Usage</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main branch [branch name]</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Creates a new branch with the given name, and
points it at the current head commit. A branch is nothing more than a
name for a reference (a SHA-1 identifier)
to a commit node. This command does NOT immediately switch to the newly
created branch (just as in real Git).
Before you
ever call branch, your code should be running with a default branch
called “master”.</p>

<p>All right, let’s see what branch does in detail. Suppose our state
looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="image/simple_history.png" alt="Simple history" /></p>

<p>Now we call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main branch cool-beans</code>. Then we get this:</p>

<p><img src="image/just_called_branch.png" alt="Just called branch" /></p>

<p>Hmm… nothing much happened. Let’s switch to the branch with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main
checkout cool-beans</code>:</p>

<p><img src="image/just_switched_branch.png" alt="Just switched branch" /></p>

<p>Nothing much happened again?! Okay, say we make a commit now. Modify
some files, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main add...</code> then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main commit...</code></p>

<p><img src="image/commit_on_branch.png" alt="Commit on branch" /></p>

<p>I was told there would be branching. But all I see is a straight line.
What’s going on? Maybe I should go back to my other branch with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java
gitlet.Main checkout master</code>:</p>

<p><img src="image/checkout_master.png" alt="Checkout master" /></p>

<p>Now I make a commit…</p>

<p><img src="image/branched.png" alt="Branched" /></p>

<p>Phew! So that’s the whole idea of branching. Did you catch what’s
going on? All that creating a branch does is to give us a new pointer. At any
given time, one of these pointers is considered the currently active
pointer, also called the HEAD pointer (indicated by *). We can switch the
currently active head pointer with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkout [branch name]</code>. Whenever
we commit, it means we add a child commit to the currently active HEAD commit
even if there is already a child commit. This naturally creates branching
behavior as a commit can now have multiple children.</p>

<p>A video example and overview of branching can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/desB3AS6aZg">here</a></p>

<p>Make <em>sure</em> that the behavior of your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkout</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit</code> match what we’ve described above. This is pretty core
functionality of Gitlet that many other commands will depend upon. If
any of this core functionality is broken, very many of our autograder
tests won’t work!</p>

<h4 id="merge">merge</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main merge [branch name]</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Merges files from the given branch into the current
branch. This method is a bit complicated, so here’s a more detailed
description:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>First consider what we call the <strong>split point</strong> of the
current branch and the given branch.
For example, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> is the current branch and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch</code> is the given
branch:
<img src="image/split_point.png" alt="Split point" />
The split point is a <em>latest common ancestor</em> of the current and given
branch heads:
    - A <em>common ancestor</em> is a commit to which there is a path
      (of 0 or more parent pointers) from both branch heads.
    - A <em>latest</em> common ancestor is a common ancestor that is not an
      ancestor of any other common ancestor.
For example, although the leftmost commit in the diagram above is a
common ancestor of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch</code>, it is also an ancestor of the
commit immediately to its right, so it is not a latest common
ancestor.
If the split point <em>is</em> the same commit as the given branch, then
we do nothing; the merge is complete, and the operation ends with the
message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Given branch is an ancestor of the current branch.</code>
If the split point is the current branch, then the effect is to
check out the given branch, and the operation
ends after printing the message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Current branch fast-forwarded.</code>
Otherwise, we continue
with the steps below.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Any files that have been <em>modified</em> in the given branch since
    the split point, but not modified in the current branch since
    the split point should be changed to their versions in the given
    branch (checked out from the commit at the front of the given
    branch). These files should then all be automatically staged.
    To clarify, if a file is “modified in the given branch since the
    split point” this means the version of the file as it exists in
    the commit at the front of the given branch has different
    content from the version of the file at the split point. Remember: blobs
    are content addressable!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any files that have been modified in the current branch but not
    in the given branch since the split point should stay as they
    are.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any files that have been modified in both the current and
    given branch in the same way (i.e., both files now have the same
    content or were both removed) are left unchanged by the merge.
    If a file was removed from both the current and given branch, but a file
    of the same name is present in the working directory, it is left alone and
    continues to be absent (not tracked nor staged) in the merge.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any files that were not present at the split point and are
    present only in the current branch should remain as they are.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any files that were not present at the split point and are
    present only in the given branch should be checked out and
    staged.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any files present at the split point, unmodified in the current
    branch, and absent in the given branch should be removed (and untracked).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any files present at the split point, unmodified in the given branch,
    and absent in the current branch should remain absent.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any files modified in different ways
    in the current and given branches are <em>in conflict</em>.  “Modified in
    different ways” can mean that the contents of both are changed and
    different from other, or the contents of one are changed and the other
    file is deleted, or the file was absent at the split point
    and has different
    contents in the given and current branches.  In this case, replace
    the contents of the conflicted file with</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
contents of file in current branch
=======
contents of file in given branch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(replacing “contents of…” with the indicated file’s contents) and stage the
result.  Treat a deleted file in a branch as an empty file.  Use straight
concatenation here.  In the case of a file with no newline at the end, you might
well end up with something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
contents of file in current branch=======
contents of file in given branch&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is fine; people who produce non-standard, pathological files
because they don’t know the difference between a line terminator
and a line separator deserve what they get.</p>

<p>Once files have been updated according to the above, and the split point was not
the current branch or the given branch, merge automatically commits with the log
message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Merged [given branch name] into [current branch name].</code> Then, if the
merge encountered a conflict, print the message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Encountered a merge conflict.</code>
on the terminal (not the log).  Merge commits differ from other commits: they
record as parents both the head of the current branch (called the <em>first
parent</em>) and the head of the branch given on the command line to be merged in.</p>

<p>A video walkthrough of this command can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR3OYCMv9b4&amp;t=929s">here</a>.</p>

<p>By the way, we hope you’ve noticed that the set of commits has progressed
  from a simple sequence to a tree and now, finally, to a full
  directed acyclic graph.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Runtime</strong>: $O(N\lg N + D)$, where $N$ is the total number
of ancestor commits for the two branches and $D$ is the total amount of
data in all the files under these commits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failure cases</strong>: If there are staged additions or removals present,
print the error message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">You have uncommitted changes.</code> and exit.
If a branch with the given name does not exist,
print the error message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A branch with that name does not exist.</code> If
attempting to merge a branch with itself, print the error message
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cannot merge a branch with itself.</code> If merge would generate an
error because the commit that it does has no changes in it, just let
the normal commit error message for this go through.
If an untracked file in the current commit would be overwritten or deleted by the merge, print
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">There is an untracked file in the way; delete it, or add and commit it first.</code> and
exit; perform this check before doing anything else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dangerous?</strong>: Yes!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Differences from real git</strong>:
Real Git does a more subtle job of merging files, displaying conflicts only
in places where both files have changed since the split point.</p>

    <p>Real Git has a different way to decide which of multiple possible split
points to use.</p>

    <p>Real Git will force the user to resolve the merge
conflicts before committing to complete the merge. Gitlet just
commits the merge, conflicts and all, so that you must use a separate
commit to resolve problems.</p>

    <p>Real Git will complain if there are unstaged changes to a file that
would be changed by a merge.  You may do so as well if you want, but we
will not test that case.</p>

#### rebase

- __Usage__: `java gitlet.Main rebase [branch name]`

- __Description__: Conceptually, what rebase does is find the split
  point of the current branch and the given branch, then snaps off the
  current branch at this point, then reattaches the current branch to
  the head of the given branch. Say we are on branch `branch` and we
  make the call `java gitlet.Main rebase master`: ![Conceptual
  rebase](image/conceptual_rebase.png) Now, this may prompt two
  questions:

    - _Why would you ever want to do this?_ You can think of it as an
      alternative to merge, where instead of having two branches that
      come together, you just pretend as if one of the branches came
      after the other one. If you use it smartly, this can create a
      cleaner history than merge.

    - _Doesn't this ruin what you said about the commit tree being
      immutable?_ Yes, it does! That's because we just lied to you in
      the picture above. In fact, rebase does not break off the
      current branch. Instead, it leaves the current branch there, but
      makes a _copy_ of the current branch on top of the given branch
      (this is called _replaying_ the branch). Then it moves the
      branch pointer to point to this copy, so that you can pretend
      you moved it. Here's the real picture: ![Real
      rebase](image/real_rebase.png) The replayed commits should
      have new ids, not copies of the original ids. This allows you to
      still access the original commits using their old ids, if you
      really wanted to. In addition, the replayed commits should have
      new time stamps, allowing you to distinguish them from the
      originals in `global-log`.

Rebase has one special case to look out for. If the current branch
pointer is in the history of the given branch, rebase just moves the
current branch to point to the same commit that the given branch
points to. No commits are replayed in this case.

There's one more point to make about rebase: If the commit at the
front of the given branch has files that have been modified since the
split point, these these changes should _propagate through_ the
replay. This means, essentially, that the versions of the files in the
given branch should take the place of their counterparts in the
replayed commits, up until one of the replayed commits has a version
of the file that had also been modified since the split point. In this
case, what you might expect to happen is that you would get conflicted
files, much like merge. However, for simplicity, we're not going to
have you deal with conflicts in rebase: in this case, just keep the
current branch's copies of the files. The bottom line: A file from the
given branch stops propagating through once it meets a modified file
in the replayed branch.

Finally, after successfully replaying nodes, reset to the node at the
front of the replayed branch.

By the way, if there are multiple branches after the split point, you
should NOT replay the other branches. For example, say we are on
branch `branch1` and we make the call `java gitlet.Main rebase master`:
![Branching rebase](/materials/proj/proj2/image/branching_rebase.png)

- __Runtime__: Should be linear relative to the history of the current
  branch and the given branch. Should also be linear in terms of the
  number of files added to both branches. Should also be linear
  relative to the total size of files added to the given branch. Also,
  be aware that rebase should not need to make any additional backup
  copies of files.

- __Failure cases__: If a branch with the given name does not exist,
  print the error message `A branch with that name does not exist.` If
  the given branch name is the same as the current branch name, print
  the error message `Cannot rebase a branch onto itself.` If the input
  branch's head is in the history of the current branch's head, print
  the error message `Already up-to-date.`

- __Dangerous?__: Yes.

- __Differences from the real git__: The real git's rebase is a
  complicated and many-flagged command. Gitlet's rebase really only
  gets at the core idea. In particular, the way it handles
  conflicts is much different! For instance, the real rebase will
  pause when it encounters a conflict, make the user fix it, and then
  continue on after.

<h2 id="skeleton">Skeleton</h2>

<p>The skeleton is fairly bare bones with mostly empty classes. We’ve provided
helpful javadoc comments hinting at what you might want to include in each file.
<strong>You should follow a similar approach to Capers</strong> where your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Main</code> class
doesn’t do a whole lot of work by itself, but rather simply calls other methods
depending on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">args</code>. You’re absolutely welcome to delete the other classes
or add your own, <strong>but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Main</code> class should remain</strong> otherwise our tests
won’t be able to find your code.</p>

<p>If you’re confused on where to start, we suggest looking over <a href="../../lab/lab6/lab6.html">Lab 6: Canine
Capers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="design-document">Design Document</h2>

<p>Since you are not working from a substantial skeleton this time, <strong>we are
asking that everybody submit a design document describing their implementation
strategy</strong>.  It is not graded, but you must have an up-to-date and completed
design document before we help you in Office Hours or on a Gitbug. If you do not
have one or it’s not up-to-date/not complete, we cannot help you. This is for
both of our sakes: by having a design doc, you have written out a road map for
how you will tackle the assignment. If you need help creating a design document,
we can definately help with that :) Here are <a href="design.html">some guidelines</a>,
as well as an <a href="https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2/capers-example">example from the Capers lab</a>.</p>

      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, it will comment on (but not score):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whether you pass style checks (it will ignore <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TODO</code>-type comments for now; we
won’t in the final submission.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We <strong><em>will</em></strong> score these in your final submission.
EDITED 3/4: It’s ok to have compiler warnings.</p>

<p>You’ll have a maximum capacity of 1 token which will refresh every 20 minutes.
You will not get full logs on these failures (i.e. you will be told what test
you failed but not any additional message), though since you have the tests
themselves you can simply debug it locally.</p>

<h3 id="full-grader">Full Grader</h3>

<p>Due 4/2 at 11:59 PM for 1600 points.</p>

<p>The full grader is a more substantial and comprehensive test suite. You’ll have
a maximum capacity of 1 token. Here is the schedule of token recharge rates:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>2/20 - 3/19:</strong> Once every 6 hours</li>
  <li><strong>3/20 - 3/26:</strong> Once every 3 hours</li>
  <li><strong>3/26 - 4/2:</strong> Once every 20 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll see that, like Project 1, there is limited access to the grader. Please
be kind to yourself and write tests along the way so you do not become too
reliant on the autograder for checking your work.</p>

<p>Similar to the checkpoint, the full grader will have English hints on what each
test does but not the actual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.in</code> file.</p>

<h3 id="snaps-grader">Snaps Grader</h3>

<p>Due 4/9 at 11:59 PM. <strong>Your Gradescope score will not be transferred to Beacon
until you’ve pushed your snaps repo and submitted to the Snaps Gradescope
assignment.</strong> To push your snaps repo, run these commands:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$SNAPS_DIR</span>
git push
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After you’ve pushed your snaps repository, there is a Gradescope assignment that
you will submit your snaps-sp21-s*** repository to (similar to Project 1). This
is only for the full grader (not the checkpoint nor the extra credit
assignment).</p>

<p>You can do this up to a week after the deadline as well in case you forget. If
you forget to push after a week, then you’ll have to use slip days.</p>

<h3 id="extra-credit">Extra credit</h3>

<p>There are a total of 16 + 32 + 64 = 112 extra credit points possible:</p>
<ol>
  <li>16 for the checkpoint</li>
  <li>32 for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code> command printing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Modifications Not Staged For
Commit</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Untracked Files</code> sections</li>
  <li>64 for the remote commands</li>
</ol>

<p>The rest of this spec is filled resources for you that you should read to get
you started. <strong>The section on testing/debugging will be extremely helpful to
you</strong> as testing and debugging in this project will be different than previous
projects, but not so complicated.</p>

<h2 id="miscellaneous-things-to-know-about-the-project">Miscellaneous Things to Know about the Project</h2>

<p>Phew! That was a lot of commands to go over just now. But don’t worry, not all
commands are of the same difficulty. You can see for each command the
approximate number of lines we took to do each part (this only counts code
specific to that command – it doesn’t double-count code reused in multiple
commands). You shouldn’t worry about matching our solution exactly, but
hopefully it gives you an idea about the relative time consumed by each command.
Merge is a lengthier command than the others, so don’t leave it for the last
minute!</p>

<p>This is an ambitious project, and it would not be surprising for you
to feel lost as to where to begin.  Therefore, feel free to collaborate with
others a little more closely than usual, with the following caveats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Acknowledge all collaborators in comments near the beginning of your
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlet/Main.java</code> file.</li>
  <li>Don’t share specific code; all collaborators must produce their own versions
of the algorithms they come up with, so that we can see they differ.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Ed megathreads typically get very long for Gitlet, but they are full of very
good conversation and discussion on the approach for particular commits. In this
project more than any you should take advantage of the size of the class and see
if you can find someone with a similar question to you on the megathread. It’s
very unlikely that your question is so unique to you that nobody else has had it
(unless it is a bug that relates to your design, in which case you should submit
a Gitbug).</p>

<p>By now this spec has given you enough information to get
working on the project. But to help you out some more, there are a
couple of things you should be aware of:</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-files">Dealing with Files</h2>
<p>This project requires reading and writing of files. In order to do
these operations, you might find the classes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.io.File</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.nio.file.Files</code> helpful. Actually, you may find various things
in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.io</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.nio</code> packages helpful. Be sure to read the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlet.Utils</code> package for other things we’ve written for you.
If you do a little
digging through all of these, you might find a couple of methods that will
make the io portion of this project <em>much</em> easier! One warning: If
you find yourself using readers, writers, scanners, or streams,
you’re making things more complicated than need be.</p>

<h2 id="serialization-details">Serialization Details</h2>
<p>If you think about Gitlet, you’ll notice that you can only run one
command every time you run the program. In order to successfully
complete your version-control system, you’ll need to remember the
commit tree across commands. This means you’ll have to design not just a
set of classes to represent internal Gitlet structures during execution,
but you’ll need an analogous representation as files within your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code>
directories, which will carry across multiple runs of your program.</p>

<p>As indicated earlier, the convenient way to do this is to serialize
the runtime objects that you will need to store permanently in files.
The Java runtime does all the work of figuring out what fields need to be
converted to bytes and how to do so.</p>

<p>You’ve already done serialization in lab6 and so we will not repeat the
information here. If you are still confused on some aspect of serialization,
re-read the relevant portion of the lab6 spec and also look over your code.</p>

<p>There is, however, one annoying subtlety to watch out for: Java serialization
follows pointers.  That is, not only is the object you pass into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writeObject</code>
serialized and written, but any object it points to as well.  If your internal
representation of commits, for example, represents the parent commits as
pointers to other commit objects, then writing the head of a branch will
write all the commits (and blobs) in the entire subgraph of commits
into one file, which is generally not what you want.  To avoid this,
don’t use Java pointers to
refer to commits and blobs in your runtime objects, but instead use
SHA-1 hash strings.  Maintain a runtime map between these strings
and the runtime objects they refer to.  You create and fill in this map
while Gitlet is running, but never read or write it to a file.</p>

<p>You might find
it convenient to have (redundant) pointers commits as well as SHA-1 strings
to avoid the bother and execution time required to look them up each time.
You can store such pointers in your objects while still avoiding having them
written out by declaring them “transient”, as in</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    private transient MyCommitType parent1;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Such fields will not be serialized, and when back in and deserialized, will be
set to their default values (null for reference types).
You must be careful when reading the
objects that contain transient fields back in to set the transient fields to
appropriate values.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, looking at the serialized files your program has produced with
a text editor (for debugging purposes) would be rather unrevealing;
the contents are encoded in Java’s
private serialization encoding.  We have therefore provided a simple debugging
utility program you might find useful: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlet.DumpObj</code>. See the Javadoc
comment on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlet/DumpObj.java</code> for details.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>You should read through this entire section, though a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMYpuQuHGu0&amp;t=752s">video</a> is also avilable for
your convenience.</p>

<p>As usual, testing is part of the project.  Be sure to provide
your own integration tests for each of the commands, covering all the specified
functionality.  Also, feel free add any unit tests you’d like. We don’t provide
any unit tests since unit tests are highly dependent on your implementation.</p>

<p>We have provided a testing program that makes it relatively easy to write
integration tests: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testing/tester.py</code>.  This interprets
testing files with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.in</code> extension. You may run all of the tests with the
command</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>make check
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’d like additional information on the failed tests, such as what your
program is outputting, run:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>make check <span class="nv">TESTER_FLAGS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"--verbose"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’d like to run a single test, within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testing</code> subdirectory, run
the command</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 tester.py <span class="nt">--verbose</span> FILE.in ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FILE.in ...</code> is a list of specific <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.in</code> files you want to check.</p>

<p><strong>CAREFUL RUNNING THIS COMMAND</strong> as it does not recompile your code. Every
time you run a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code> command, you must first compile your code (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code>).</p>

<p>The command</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 tester.py <span class="nt">--verbose</span> <span class="nt">--keep</span> FILE.in
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>will, in addition, keep around the directory that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tester.py</code> produces so
that you can examine its files at the point the tester script detected an
error. If your test did not error, then the directory will still remain there
with the final contents of everything.</p>

<p>In effect, the tester implements a very simple <em>domain-specific language (DSL)</em>
that contains commands to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set up or remove files from a testing directory;</li>
  <li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main</code>;</li>
  <li>Check the output of Gitlet against a specific output or a regular expression
describing possible outputs;</li>
  <li>Check the presence, absence, and contents of files.
Running the command</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 testing/tester.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(with no operands, as shown)
will provide a message documenting this language.
We’ve provided some examples in the directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testing/samples</code>.  Don’t
put your own tests in that subdirectory; place them somewhere distinct so you
don’t get confused with our tests vs your tests (which may be buggy!). Put all
your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.in</code> files in another folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">student_tests</code> within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testing</code>
directory. In the skeleton, this folder is blank.</p>

<p>We’ve added a few things to the Makefile to adjust for differences in people’s
setups.  If your system’s command for invoking Python 3 is simply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code>, you
can still use our makefile unchanged by using</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>make <span class="nv">PYTHON</span><span class="o">=</span>python check
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can pass additional flags to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tester.py</code> with, for example:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>make TESTER_FLAGS="--keep --verbose"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="testing-on-the-staff-solution">Testing on the Staff Solution</h2>

<p>As of Sunday February 28th, there is now a way for you to use the staff solution
to verify your understanding of commands as well as verify your own tests! The
guide is <a href="../../guides/staff-gitlet.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-integration-tests">Understanding Integration Tests</h2>

<p>The first thing we’ll ask for in Gitbugs and when you come to receive help in
Office Hours is a test that you’re failing, so it’s paramount that you learn to
write tests in this project.  We’ve done a lot of work to make this as painless
as possible, so please take the time to read through this section so you can
understand the provided tests and write good tests yourself.</p>

<p>The integration tests are of similar format to those from Capers. If you don’t
know how the Capers integration tests (i.e. the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.in</code> files) work, then read
that section from the <a href="../../lab/lab6/lab6.html">capers spec</a> first.</p>

<p>The provided tests are hardly comprehensive, and you’ll definitely need to write
your own tests to get a full score on the project. To write a test, let’s first
understand how this all works.</p>

<p>Here is the structure of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testing</code> directory:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.
├── Makefile
├── student_tests                    &lt;==== Your .in files will go here
├── samples                          &lt;==== Sample .in files we provide
│   ├── test01-init.in               &lt;==== An example test
│   ├── test02-basic-checkout.in
│   ├── test03-basic-log.in
│   ├── test04-prev-checkout.in
│   └── definitions.inc
├── src                              &lt;==== Contains files used for testing
│   ├── notwug.txt
│   └── wug.txt
├── runner.py                        &lt;==== Script to help debug your program
└── tester.py                        &lt;==== Script that tests your program
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just like Capers, these tests work by creating a temporary directory within the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testing</code> directory and running the commands specified by a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.in</code> file. If you
use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--keep</code> flag, this temporary directory will remain after the test
finishes so you can inspect it.</p>

<p>Unlike Capers, we’ll need to deal with the <em>contents</em> of files in our working
directory. So in this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testing</code> folder, we have an additional folder called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code>. This directory stores many pre-filled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> files that have particular
contents we need. We’ll come back to this later, but for now just know that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> stores actual file contents. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">samples</code> has the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.in</code> files of the
sample tests (which are the checkpoint tests). When you create your own tests,
you should add them to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">student_tests</code> folder which is initially empty in
the skeleton.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.in</code> files have more functions in Gitlet. Here is the explanation straight
from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tester.py</code> file:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># ...  A comment, producing no effect.
I FILE Include.  Replace this statement with the contents of FILE,
      interpreted relative to the directory containing the .in file.
C DIR  Create, if necessary, and switch to a subdirectory named DIR under
      the main directory for this test.  If DIR is missing, changes
      back to the default directory.  This command is principally
      intended to let you set up remote repositories.
T N    Set the timeout for gitlet commands in the rest of this test to N
      seconds.
+ NAME F
      Copy the contents of src/F into a file named NAME.
- NAME
      Delete the file named NAME.
&gt; COMMAND OPERANDS
LINE1
LINE2
...
&lt;&lt;&lt;
      Run gitlet.Main with COMMAND ARGUMENTS as its parameters.  Compare
      its output with LINE1, LINE2, etc., reporting an error if there is
      "sufficient" discrepency.  The &lt;&lt;&lt; delimiter may be followed by
      an asterisk (*), in which case, the preceding lines are treated as
      Python regular expressions and matched accordingly. The directory
      or JAR file containing the gitlet.Main program is assumed to be
      in directory DIR specifed by --progdir (default is ..).
= NAME F
      Check that the file named NAME is identical to src/F, and report an
      error if not.
* NAME
      Check that the file NAME does not exist, and report an error if it
      does.
E NAME
      Check that file or directory NAME exists, and report an error if it
      does not.
D VAR "VALUE"
      Defines the variable VAR to have the literal value VALUE.  VALUE is
      taken to be a raw Python string (as in r"VALUE").  Substitutions are
      first applied to VALUE.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Don’t worry about the Python regular expressions thing mentioned in the above
description: we’ll show you that it’s fairly straightforward and even go through
an example of how to use it.</p>

<p>Let’s walk through a test to see what happens from start to finish. Let’s
examine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test02-basic-checkout.in</code>.</p>

<h4 id="example-test">Example test</h4>

<p>When we first run this test, a temporary directory gets created that is
initially empty. Our directory structure is now:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.
├── Makefile
├── student_tests
├── samples
│   ├── test01-init.in
│   ├── test02-basic-checkout.in
│   ├── test03-basic-log.in
│   ├── test04-prev-checkout.in
│   └── definitions.inc
├── src
│   ├── notwug.txt
│   └── wug.txt
├── test02-basic-checkout_0          &lt;==== Just created
├── runner.py
└── tester.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This temporary directory is the Gitlet repository that will be used for this
execution of the test, so we will add things there and run all of our Gitlet
commands there as well.  If you ran the test a second time without deleting the
directory, it’ll create a new directory called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test02-basic-checkout_1</code>, and so
on.  Each execution of a test uses it’s own directory, so don’t worry about
tests interfering with each other as that cannot happen.</p>

<p>The first line of the test is a comment, so we ignore it.</p>

<p>The next section is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; init
&lt;&lt;&lt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This shouldn’t have any output as we can tell by this section not having any
text between the first line with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> and the line with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>. But, as we know,
this should create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> folder. So our directory structure is now:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.
├── Makefile
├── student_tests
├── samples
│   ├── test01-init.in
│   ├── test02-basic-checkout.in
│   ├── test03-basic-log.in
│   ├── test04-prev-checkout.in
│   └── definitions.inc
├── src
│   ├── notwug.txt
│   └── wug.txt
├── test02-basic-checkout_0
│   └── .gitlet                     &lt;==== Just created
├── runner.py
└── tester.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next section is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>+ wug.txt wug.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This line uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> command. This will take the file on the right-hand
side from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> directory and copy its contents to the file on the
left-hand side in the temporary directory (creating it if it doesn’t exist).
They happen to have the same name, but that doesn’t matter since they’re in
different directories. After this command, our directory structure is now:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.
├── Makefile
├── student_tests
├── samples
│   ├── test01-init.in
│   ├── test02-basic-checkout.in
│   ├── test03-basic-log.in
│   ├── test04-prev-checkout.in
│   └── definitions.inc
├── src
│   ├── notwug.txt
│   └── wug.txt
├── test02-basic-checkout_0
│   ├── .gitlet
│   └── wug.txt                     &lt;==== Just created
├── runner.py
└── tester.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we see what the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> directory is used for: it contains file contents that
the tests can use to set up the Gitlet repository however you wants. If you want
to add special contents to a file, you should add those contents to an
appropriately named file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> and then use the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> command as we have
here. It’s easy to get confused with the order of arguments, so make sure the
right-hand side is referencing the file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> directory, and the
left-hand side is referencing the file in the temporary directory.</p>

<p>The next section is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; add wug.txt
&lt;&lt;&lt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As you can see, there should be no output. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wug.txt</code> file is now staged for
addition in the temporary directory. At this point, your directory structure
will likely change within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test02-basic-checkout_0/.gitlet</code> directory since
you’ll need to somehow persist the fact that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wug.txt</code> is staged for addition.</p>

<p>The next section is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; commit "added wug"
&lt;&lt;&lt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And, again, there is no output, and, again, your directory strcuture within
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> might change.</p>

<p>The next section is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>+ wug.txt notwug.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wug.txt</code> already exists in our temporary directory, its contents changes
to be whatever was in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/notwug.txt</code>.</p>

<p>The next section is</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; checkout -- wug.txt
&lt;&lt;&lt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which, again, has no output. However, it should change the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wug.txt</code>
in our temporary directory back to its original contents which is exactly the
contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/wug.txt</code>. The next command is what asserts that:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>= wug.txt wug.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is an assertion: if the file on the left-hand side (again, this is in the
temporary directory) doesn’t have the exact contents of the file on the
right-hand side (from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> directory), the testing script will error and
say your file contents are not correct.</p>

<p>There are two other assertion commands available to you:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E NAME
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Will assert that there exists a file/folder named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NAME</code> in the temporary
directory. It doesn’t check the contents, only that it exists. If no file/folder
with that name exists, the test will fail.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>* NAME
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Will assert that there does NOT exist a file/folder named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NAME</code> in the
temporary directory. If there does exist a file/folder with that name, the test
will fail.</p>

<p>That happened to be the last line of the test, so the test finishes. If the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--keep</code> flag was provided, the temporary directory will remain, otherwise it
will be deleted. You might want to keep it if you suspect your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code>
directory is not being properly setup or there is some issue with persistence.</p>

<h4 id="setup-for-a-test">Setup for a test</h4>

<p>As you’ll soon discover, there can be a lot of repeated setup to test a
particular command: for example, if you’re testing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkout</code> command you
need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Initialize a Gitlet Repository</li>
  <li>Create a commit with a file in some version (v1)</li>
  <li>Create another commit with that file in some other version (v2)</li>
  <li>Checkout that file to v1</li>
</ol>

<p>And perhaps even more if you want to test with files that were untracked in the
second commit but tracked in the first.</p>

<p>So the way you can save yourself time is by adding all that setup in a file and
using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I</code> command. Say we do that here:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Initialize, add, and commit a file.
&gt; init
&lt;&lt;&lt;
+ a.txt wug.txt
&gt; add a.txt
&lt;&lt;&lt;
&gt; commit "a is a wug"
&lt;&lt;&lt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We should place this file with the rest of the tests in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">samples</code> directory,
but with a file extension <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.inc</code>, so maybe we name it
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">samples/commit_setup.inc</code>. If we gave it the file extension <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.in</code>, our testing
script will mistake it for a test and try to run it individually. Now, in our
actual test, we simply use the command:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I commit_setup.inc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will have the testing script run all of the commands in that file and keep
the temporary directory it creates. This keeps your tests relatively short and
thus easier to read.</p>

<p>We’ve included one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.inc</code> file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">definitions.inc</code> that will set up
patterns for your convenience. Let’s understand what patterns are.</p>

<h4 id="pattern-matching-output">Pattern matching output</h4>

<p>The most confusing part of testing is the output for something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log</code>. There
are a few reasons why:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The commit SHA will change as you modify your code and hash more things, so
you would have to continually modify your test to keep up with the changes to
the SHA.</li>
  <li>Your date will change every time since time only moves forwards.</li>
  <li>It makes the tests very long.</li>
</ol>

<p>We also don’t really care the exact text: just that there is some SHA there and
something with the right date format. For this reason, our tests use pattern
matching.</p>

<p>This is not a concept you will need to understand, but at a high level we define
a pattern for some text (i.e. a commit SHA) and then just check that the output
has that pattern (without caring about the actual letters and numbers).</p>

<p>Here is how you’d do that for the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log</code> and check that it matches the
pattern:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># First "import" the pattern defintions from our setup
I definitions.inc
# You would add your lines here that create commits with the
# specified messages. We'll omit this for this example.
&gt; log
===
${COMMIT_HEAD}
added wug

===
${COMMIT_HEAD}
initial commit

&lt;&lt;&lt;*
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The section we see is the same as a normal Gitlet command, except it ends in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;&lt;&lt;*</code> which tells the testing script to use patterns. The patterns are enclosed
in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${PATTERN_NAME}</code>.</p>

<p>All the patterns are defined in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">samples/definitions.inc</code>. You don’t need to
understand the actual pattern, just the thing it matches. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEADER</code>
matches the header of a commit which should look something like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>commit fc26c386f550fc17a0d4d359d70bae33c47c54b9
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s just some random commit SHA.</p>

<p>So when we create the expected output for this test, we’ll need to know how many
entries are in this log and what the commit messages are.</p>

<p>You can do similar things for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code> command:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I definitions.inc
# Add commands here to setup the status. We'll omit them here.
&gt; status
=== Branches ===
\*master

=== Staged Files ===
g.txt

=== Removed Files ===

=== Modifications Not Staged For Commit ===

=== Untracked Files ===
${ARBLINES}

&lt;&lt;&lt;*
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The pattern we used here is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARBLINES</code> which is arbitrary lines. If you actually
care what is untracked, then you can add that here without the pattern, but
perhaps we’re more interested in seeing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g.txt</code> staged for addition.</p>

<p>Notice the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\*</code> on the branch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>. Recall that in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code> command, you
should prefix the HEAD branch with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>. If you use a pattern, you’ll need to
replace this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\*</code> in the expected output. The reason is out of the
scope of the class, but it is called “escaping” the asterisk. If you don’t use a
pattern (i.e.  your command ends in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;&lt;&lt;*</code>, then you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>
without the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code>).</p>

<p>The final thing you can do with these patterns is “save” a matched portion.
<strong>Warning</strong>: this seems like magic and we don’t care at all if you understand how
this works, just know that it does and it is available to you. You can copy and
paste the relevant part from our provided tests so you don’t need to worry too
much about making these from scratch. With that out of the way, let’s see what
this is.</p>

<p>If you’re doing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkout</code> command, you need to use the SHA identifier to
specify which commit to checkout to/from. But remember we used patterns, so we
don’t actually know the SHA identifier at the time of creating the test. That is
problematic. We’ll use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test04-prev-checkout.in</code> to see how you can “capture” or “save” the SHA:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I definitions.inc
# Each ${COMMIT_HEAD} captures its commit UID.
# Not shown here, but the test sets up the log by making many commits
# with specific messages.
&gt; log
===
${COMMIT_HEAD}
version 2 of wug.txt

===
${COMMIT_HEAD}
version 1 of wug.txt

===
${COMMIT_HEAD}
initial commit

&lt;&lt;&lt;*
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will set up the UID (SHA) to be captured after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log</code> command. So right
after this command runs, we can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code> command to define the UIDs to
variables:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># UID of second version
D UID2 "${1}"
# UID of first version
D UID1 "${2}"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how the numbering is backwards: the numbering begins at 1 and starts at
the top of the log. That is why the current version (i.e. second version) is
defined as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"${1}"</code>. We don’t care about the initial commit, so we don’t bother
capturing it’s UID.</p>

<p>Now we can use that definition to checkout to that captured SHA:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; checkout ${UID1} -- wug.txt
&lt;&lt;&lt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now you can make your assertions to ensure the checkout was successful.</p>

<h4 id="testing-conclusion">Testing conclusion</h4>

<p>There are many more complex things you can do with our testing script, but this
is enough to write very good tests. You should use our provided tests as an
example to get started, and also feel free to discuss on Ed high level ideas of
how to test things. You may also share your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.in</code> files, but please make
sure they’re correct before posting them and add comments so other students and
staff can see what is going on.</p>

<h2 id="debugging-integration-tests">Debugging Integration Tests</h2>

<p>Recall from <a href="../../lab/lab6/lab6.html">Lab 6</a> that debugging integration tests is a
bit different with the new setup. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runner.py</code> script will work just as it
did for Capers, so you should read through that section in the Lab 6 spec and
watch the video linked there. Here we describe strategies to debug:</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-right-execution-to-debug">Finding the right execution to debug</h3>

<p>Each test runs your program multiple times, and each one of them has the
potential to introduce a bug. The first priority is to identify the right
execution of the program that introduces the bug. What we mean by this: imagine
you’re failing a test that checks the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code> command. Say that the output
differs by just one file: you say it’s untracked, but the test says it
should be staged for addition. <strong>This does not mean the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code> command has a
bug</strong>. It’s <em>possible</em> that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code> command is buggy, but not guaranteed.
It could be that your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add</code> command didn’t properly persist the fact that a file
has been staged for addition! If that is the case, then even with a fully
functioning <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code> command, your program would error.</p>

<p>So finding the right (i.e. buggy) execution of the program is very important:
how do we do that? You step through every single execution of the program using
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runner.py</code> script, and after every execution you look at your temporary
directory to make sure everything has been written to a file correctly. This
will be harder for serialized objects since, as we know, their contents will be
a stream of unintelligable bytes: for serialized objects you can simply check
that at the time of serialization they have the correct contents. You may even
find that you <em>never serialized it</em>!</p>

<p>Eventually, you’ll find the bug. If you cannot, then that is when you can come
to Office Hours or post a Gitbug. Be warned: we can only spend 10 minutes with
each student in Office Hours, so if you have a nasty bug that you think would
take a TA more than 10 minutes, then you should instead submit a Gitbug with <strong>as
much information as possible</strong>. The better your Gitbug, the better/faster your response
will be. Don’t forget to update your design doc: remember we will reject Gitbugs
that do not have an up-to-date or complete design document.</p>

<h2 id="going-remote-extra-credit">Going Remote (Extra Credit)</h2>

<p>This project is all about mimicking git’s local features. These are
useful because they allow you to backup your own files and maintain
multiple versions of them. However, git’s true power is really in its
<em>remote</em> features, allowing collaboration with other people over the
internet. The point is that both you and your friend could be
collaborating on a single code base. If you make changes to the files,
you can send them to your friend, and vice versa. And you’ll both have
access to a shared history of all the changes either of you have made.</p>

<p>To get extra credit, implement some basic remote commands:
namely <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add-remote</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm-remote</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">push</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull</code>
You will get 64 extra-credit points for completing them.
Don’t attempt or plan for extra credit until you have completed the
rest of the project.</p>

<p>Depending on how flexibly you have designed the rest of the project,
64 extra-credit points
may not be worth the amount of effort it takes to do this section.
We’re certainly not expecting everyone to do it.
Our priority will be in helping students complete the main project;
if you’re doing the
extra credit, we expect you to be able to stand on your own a little
bit more than most students.</p>

<h2 id="the-commands-1">The Commands</h2>

<p>A few notes about the remote commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Execution time will not be graded. For your own edification, please don’t
do anything ridiculous, though.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the commands are significantly simplified from their git
equivalents, so specific differences from git are usually not
notated. Be aware they are there, however.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So now let’s go over the commands:</p>

<h4 id="add-remote">add-remote</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main add-remote [remote name] [name of remote directory]/.gitlet</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Saves the given login information under the given
remote name. Attempts to push or pull from the given remote name
will then attempt to use this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> directory.
By writing, e.g.,
    java gitlet.Main add-remote other ../testing/otherdir/.gitlet
you can provide tests of remotes that will work from all
locations (on your home machine or within the grading program’s software).
Always use forward slashes in these commands. Have your program convert
all the forward slashes into the path separator character (forward slash on
Unix and backslash on Windows).  Java helpfully defines the class variable
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.io.File.separator</code> as this character.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failure cases</strong>: If a remote with the given name already exists,
print the error message: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A remote with that name already exists.</code>
You don’t have to check if the user name and server
information are legit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dangerous?</strong>: No.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="rm-remote">rm-remote</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main rm-remote [remote name]</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Remove information associated with the given remote
name. The idea here is that if you ever wanted to change a remote
that you added, you would have to first remove it and then re-add
it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failure cases</strong>: If a remote with the
given name does not exist, print the error message: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A remote with
that name does not exist.</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dangerous?</strong>: No.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="push">push</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main push [remote name] [remote branch name]</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Attempts to append the current branch’s commits to
the end of the given branch at the given remote. Details:</p>

    <p>This command only works if the remote branch’s head is in the
history of the current local head, which means that the local
branch contains some commits in the future of the remote branch.
In this case, append the future commits to the remote branch.
Then, the remote should reset to the front of the appended
commits (so its head will be the same as the local head). This
is called fast-forwarding.</p>

    <p>If the Gitlet system on the remote machine exists but does not
have the input branch, then simply add the branch to the remote
Gitlet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failure cases</strong>: If the remote branch’s head is not in the history
of the current local head, print the error message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Please pull down
remote changes before pushing.</code>  If the remote <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> directory does not
exist, print <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Remote directory not found.</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dangerous?</strong>: No.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fetch">fetch</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main fetch [remote name] [remote branch name]</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Brings down commits from the remote Gitlet repository into the
local Gitlet repository. Basically, this copies all commits and blobs from the given
branch in the remote repository (that are not already in the current
repository) into a branch named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[remote name]/[remote branch name]</code> in the
local <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> (just
as in real Git), changing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[remote name]/[remote branch name]</code> to point
to the head commit (thus copying the contents of the branch from the remote
repository to the current one).  This branch is created in the local
repository if it did not previously exist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failure cases</strong>: If the remote Gitlet repository does not have the given
branch name, print the error message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">That remote does not have that
branch.</code>  If the remote <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitlet</code> directory does not
exist, print <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Remote directory not found.</code>
<!-- Need failure case for remote name not defined. --></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dangerous?</strong> No</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pull">pull</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java gitlet.Main pull [remote name] [remote branch name]</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Fetches branch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[remote name]/[remote branch name]</code> as
for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> command, and then merges that fetch into the current branch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Failure cases</strong>: Just the failure cases of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">merge</code>
together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dangerous?</strong> Yes!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="i-things-to-avoid">I. Things to Avoid</h2>

<p>There are few practices that experience has shown will cause you endless grief
in the form of programs that don’t work and bugs that are very hard to find
and sometimes not repeatable (“Heisenbugs”).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Since you are likely to keep various information in files (such as commits),
you might be tempted to use apparently convenient file-system operations
(such as listing a directory) to sequence through all of them.  Be
careful.  Methods such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File.list</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File.listFiles</code> produce file
names in an undefined order.  If you use them to implement the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log</code>
command, in particular, you can get random results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Windows users especially should beware that the file separator character is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> on Unix (or MacOS) and ‘\’ on Windows.  So if you form file names in
your program by concatenating some directory names and a file name together
with explicit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>s or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code>s, you can be sure that it won’t work on one
system or the other.  Java provides a system-dependent file separator
character (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">System.getProperty("file.separator")</code>), or you can use
the multi-argument constructors to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File</code>.</li>
  <li>Be careful using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HashMap</code> when serializing! The order of things within the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HashMap</code> is non-deterministic. The solution is to use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TreeMap</code> which will
always have the same order. More details <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5993752/hashmap-serialization-and-deserialization-changes">here</a></li>
</ol>
